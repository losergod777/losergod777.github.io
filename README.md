TV, but accessible for everyone, anywhere.

## BASICS

This is a website that lets you look up movies on TMDB, then uses Vidking to embed them into the website, allowing for watching. It goes into the URL too, which makes it easy to share with a preset already, while staying secure.

The URL for embeding is `https://www.vidking.net/embed/movie/xxxxxx`, with the x's representing the TMDB title. For example, https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/629542-the-bad-guys, the x's would be 629542. Not only does it let you pick which one you want, but it also automatically strips that number for you for easy playing!

## WHY?

Not everyone has access to streaming services, some of which are charging more and more while constricting to a single household, or other forms of cartoons or movies, even documentaries (I can speak first-hand on that).

## DISCLAIMERS

As marked on the website, this site does not host any video content. All movies and shows are embedded from third-party streaming providers. We do not store, upload, or distribute any media files. Users are responsible for complying with local laws regarding streaming content. Use at your own discretion.
